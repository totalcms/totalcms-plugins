# Building a Total CMS (T3) site

This project **is a website** built on Total CMS, a flat-file PHP CMS. There is
**no database** — all content is JSON under `tcms-data/`. Configure via
`config/tcms.php` (deep-merged — specify only keys you change).

## Is this copy current?

This skill is a copy of the one shipped with the installed CMS, so it can fall
behind. At the start of a session run `vendor/bin/tcms skill:install --check`.
If it reports stale, run `vendor/bin/tcms skill:install` and then tell the user
to start a new session — the text already loaded cannot replace itself. The
stamp is a hash of the skill's own content, not the release number, so only real
changes to the skill flag it.

## Where things are

T3 ships in two layouts. Check which one you are in before running anything.

- **Composer install** — the default the rest of this skill assumes. CLI `vendor/bin/tcms`; CMS code and docs under `vendor/totalcms/cms/`; config `config/tcms.php` at the project root. **Never edit `vendor/`** — an update replaces it. <!-- composer-paths -->
- **Zip install** — the CMS *is* the folder you are in (conventionally `tcms/`).
  CLI `php resources/bin/tcms`, run from that folder; docs `resources/docs/`;
  config `config/tcms.php` inside it; content in `../tcms-data/` beside it. An
  update replaces the folder's `config/ public/ resources/ src/ vendor/`
  wholesale, so **never add files inside them**.

If this skill was installed by `skill:install` on a zip install, the paths
throughout it are already rewritten for that layout.

Most commands accept `--json` for machine-readable output — prefer it when
scripting. Run `vendor/bin/tcms list` to see everything.

## Write through the CLI, never to the files

`tcms-data/` is a store, not an editing surface. It is tempting to create or
edit the JSON files in it directly — it usually appears to work, which is what
makes it dangerous. **Always go through the CLI (or the API/MCP), which is what
the admin does:**

| To… | Run |
|---|---|
| create an object | `vendor/bin/tcms object:create <collection> -` (JSON on stdin) |
| change part of an object | `vendor/bin/tcms object:patch <collection> <id> -` |
| load many objects | `vendor/bin/tcms collection:import <collection> file.json` |
| add or change a schema | `vendor/bin/tcms schema:import schema.json`, then `schema:lint <id> --strict` |
| create a collection | `vendor/bin/tcms collection:create …` |
| seed structure + content together | `vendor/bin/tcms jumpstart:import file.json` |

A save through the CLI validates the object against its schema, fills in what
the schema derives (default types, autogen ids, `created`/`updated`
timestamps, image and video metadata), updates the collection's `.index.json`
and counts, and fires the events the rest of the system listens for (search
indexing, automations, MCP change notifications). A file written by hand gets
none of that: one bad comma takes the whole collection offline, an unindexed
object is invisible to the admin tables, sitemaps and queries until
`repair:index` runs, and timestamps and derived fields are simply missing.

Reading the files is fine (`cat`, `jq`), though `object:get --json` is the
same data validated. If you ever *must* touch a file — recovering data, say —
validate the JSON, then run `vendor/bin/tcms repair:index <collection>` and,
for a schema, `schema:lint <id> --strict`.

This applies to **content and structure**. Templates under `builder/` and the
config file `config/tcms.php` are files by design — edit those directly.

## Where to look things up

You do **not** need to memorize field options or Twig signatures — they ship on disk:

- **On-disk docs (always present):** `vendor/totalcms/cms/resources/docs/<section>/`
  (`menu.php` is the table of contents, `search-index.json` a prebuilt index).
  Sections: `get-started/`, `collections/`, `schemas/`, `fields/`, `site-builder/`,
  `twig/`, `forms/`, `automations/`, `admin/`, `notifications/`, `auth/`, `apis/`,
  `mcp/`, `extensions/`, `operations/`. `references/features.md` maps every feature
  to its page. Grep or read these for the long tail.
- **MCP docs server (fastest lookup):** when the official docs connector
  (`https://totalcms.co/mcp`) is connected — it ships alongside this skill in
  the Total CMS plugin — use `docs_search` to find pages, `docs_get` to read
  one, and `docs_lookup(kind, name)` for exact reference entries (Twig
  functions/filters, field types, API endpoints, schema config, CLI commands,
  extension/builder API).
  The on-disk docs remain authoritative and work with no connection.

Prefer looking things up over guessing; training data is often stale on exact signatures.

## The build loop: add a page to the site

1. **See what already routes:** `vendor/bin/tcms builder:routes` lists every page
   the router serves and flags conflicts. `vendor/bin/tcms builder:routes --json` to script.
2. **If Site Builder isn't set up yet,** scaffold a starter:
   `vendor/bin/tcms builder:init <starter>` where `<starter>` is `business`, `blog`,
   `portfolio`, or `minimal`. Add `--frontend` to also install the Vite pipeline.
   This copies templates, ensures the `builder-pages` collection, and seeds demo pages.
3. **Edit templates** on the filesystem under
   `builder/{layouts,pages,partials,macros}/*.twig` when a project-root `builder/`
   directory exists (git-managed mode: it wins over `tcms-data/`, and the admin's
   template editor is read-only), otherwise `tcms-data/builder/`. Twig global is `cms`;
   builder helpers are `cms.builder.nav()`, `cms.builder.url(id, params)`,
   `cms.builder.css/js/asset()`. The layout's `<head>` carries
   `{% block seo %}{{ cms.seo.head(page|default(null)) }}{% endblock %}` — it emits
   title, description, canonical, Open Graph and JSON-LD, so a layout must not also
   hand-write `<title>` or `<meta name="description">`. See `references/site-builder.md`.
4. **Add a page record.** A page is an object in the `builder-pages` collection.
   Create it one of these ways:
   - `echo '{"id":"about","title":"About","route":"/about","template":"pages/page.twig"}' | vendor/bin/tcms object:create builder-pages -` (one object, file or stdin), or
   - the **admin UI** (Site Builder → Pages), or
   - `vendor/bin/tcms collection:import builder-pages <file.json>` for arrays (see `references/cli.md`), or
   - `vendor/bin/tcms jumpstart:import <file>` for bulk seeding.
   Key `builder-pages` fields: `route`, `template`, `title`, `draft`, `data` (free-form
   JSON exposed as `page.data.*`). Full list in `references/site-builder.md`.
5. **Preview:** `php -S localhost:8080 -t public public/index.php` and visit the
   page's `route`. Pass `public/index.php` as the router script — without it the
   built-in server only serves files that exist on disk and never reaches the page
   router, so every builder page 404s. Clear caches after template changes if
   needed: `vendor/bin/tcms cache:clear`. Restart the server after adding page
   records — the route index is cached in the server process.

## Writing schemas and content by hand

**Before writing any schema, read the reference schema** —
`vendor/bin/tcms schema:get totalcms --json` — and copy property definitions from it.
It demonstrates every field type with the settings and help text that go with it.
Pick fields by the shape of the value (`date`, `toggle`, `select`, `number`, `image`…);
`text` is the last resort. Write every `help` and `description` as a brief to a
writer who cannot see the site — agents read them through MCP. Rules, the
five meanings of "category", and the SEO card: `references/data-model.md`.

The admin enforces these for you. They only bite when you author JSON that the
CLI then imports — JumpStart files, `collection:import` payloads, API bodies —
which is exactly what an agent tends to write. (Authoring JSON *for the CLI to
import* is fine; writing it straight into `tcms-data/` is not — see "Write
through the CLI, never to the files" above.)

- **Every schema must define an `id` property**, not just list `id` in `required`.
  A schema missing it fails with `The required properties (id) are missing`, which
  points at your data when the bug is in the schema.
- **Decks are dictionaries of named items, not arrays.** Each key names one item and
  must equal that item's `id`:
  `{"rows": {"first_row": {"id": "first_row", ...}}}`
- **Deck item keys allow only letters, numbers, and underscores** — no hyphens, so
  Twig can read them as `deck.first_row`. `first-row` is rejected on import.
- **`field: "deckTable"`** stores exactly like a deck but edits as a table.

See `vendor/totalcms/cms/resources/docs/fields/deck.md` for the full shape.

**Schema work is done when `vendor/bin/tcms schema:lint <id> --strict` is clean** —
zero errors, zero warnings. Imports validate on the way in, but in-place edits are
never re-checked, and the linter flags every property missing the help text AI
agents rely on. Fill descriptions in on the first pass, not as a follow-up.

## Working against a live site

Two rules prevent the two worst mistakes:

- **Patch, don't replace.** When editing a live site through its MCP server,
  prefer `patch_object` (merges only the fields you send). `update_object` is a
  FULL replace — if you must use it, fetch the complete record with
  `get_object` + `format: "html"` first, edit, strip the decorated `url` key,
  and write the whole body back. Details: `references/mcp-content.md`.
- **After launch, the server owns content.** Local seed files go stale by
  design — never re-import them over live data. Use `pull`/`push` (dry-run
  first; filters are exclusive). Details: `references/going-live.md`.
